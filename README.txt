Project Description
-------------------

In this project the bot acts as a sevant, which takes commands from the user and executes them. The user has an android phone with him to which he specifies the commands in the form of speech. The speech is recognised and processed using the library, pocket sphinx. Then the command is sent to the bot via bluetooth and the bot acts accordingly. 

In the application used to demonstrate this, the bot moves on a grid to the coordinates specified by the user.
